<h2>The National Registry of Exonerations</h2>
<img src="NRE로고.png">
<p><strong>THE MISSION OF <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx" target="_blank" title="NRE 홈페이지">THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OF EXONERATIONS</a></strong> is to provide comprehensive information on exonerations of innocent criminal defendants in order to <strong><u>prevent</u> future false convictions</strong> by learning from past errors.</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">
<strong>What we do:</strong>The Registry collects, analyzes and disseminates information about all known exonerations of innocent criminal defendants in the United States, from 1989 to the present. We publish their stories and we provide accessible, searchable online statistical data about their cases. We also conduct empirical studies of the process of exoneration and of factors that lead to the underlying wrongful convictions.</p>
