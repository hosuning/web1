<h2>Conviction Integrity Units 이란?</h2>
<p>A Conviction Integrity Unit (CIU) is a division of a prosecutorial office that works to prevent, identify, and remedy false convictions.</p>
<p>
Several Conviction Integrity Units have accomplished a great deal in a short period of time, and there has certainly been an uptick in the number of offices that claim to have formed CIUs. It is still too soon to know whether this trend will produce a change in the way prosecutors operate generally. For more information on the history of CIUs, please see the annual report excerpts linked below.
