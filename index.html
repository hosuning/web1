<h2>이노센스 프로젝트</h2>
<p>The Innocence Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit legal organization that is committed to exonerating wrongly convicted people through the use of DNA testing and to reforming the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.[7] The group cites various studies estimating that in the United States, between 2.3% and 5% of all prisoners are innocent.[8] The Innocence Project was founded in 1992 by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld.</p>
